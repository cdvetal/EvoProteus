EvoProteus is a Processing application that evolves parametric combinations of other Processing programs. The software provided here is for CDV members' consultation only. At this point, we are unable to provide a generic pipeline that makes the launch of EvoProteus possible on any laptop. In case any of you has interest in the tool and wants to try it, please contact me at <ins>sacadura@dei.uc.pt</ins>.
